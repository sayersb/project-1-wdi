Computer shows a pattern of lit up squares
Player 1 needs to replicate the pattern
Assuming player 1 keeps answering correctly the computer keeps adding more squares, maybe getting faster..
When Player 1 is incorrect = big you lose pops up(alert maybe, also saying find out if you beat the other pathetic human..)
Player 1 result needs to be logged to later compare to player2
Then switches to Player 2 turn
Computer pattern to light up squares again, better if its random generator again so not same pattern player 1 saw..
Player 2 keeps answering until incorrect
When player 2 loses need to pop up again with big LOSER
Display who won, then offer to play again and restart. Score logged to scoreboard or lives go down by 1
If draw say you're both losers, try again for a winner.. -->
