# GA WDI-34 PROJECT 1 - CHAIN GAME


## Instructions

After pressing the start button the computer will randomly generate a sequence of squares lighting up on the board. You have to remember the order of the pattern and then repeat it after the lights have turned off. If you're correct push the next level button to start the next computer sequence.
One square is added to the computer sequence each level.
When you lose don't forget to remember what level you reached & hit the restart button for your friend.

## PLANNED FEATURES

Given a bit more time I would have added in a high score function that remembers & shows the highest score from the session. Another feature that could be implemented would be a welcome screen when you load the page or start the first game of the session. Similarly the game could have a GAME OVER screen that hides the main board and shows a funny photo after the person loses.
I could also do my best to find more songs that I love with the word CHAIN in the song name... On the music note I could also implement a feature that stops all of the music and then makes different sounds very time the squares are lit up.
