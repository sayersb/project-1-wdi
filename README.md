When Player 1 is incorrect = big you lose pops up(alert maybe, also saying find out if you beat the other pathetic human..)...
Player 1 result needs to be logged to later compare to player2...
Then switches to Player 2 turn...
Computer pattern to light up squares again, better if its random generator again so not same pattern... player 1 saw...
Player 2 keeps answering until incorrect...
When player 2 loses need to pop up again with big LOSER...
